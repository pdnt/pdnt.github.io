      <description>After publishing my article &amp;ldquo;Integrating a deployment counter to your CI/CD pipeline&amp;rdquo;, my static website recibed about 1.3k visits, not alot but it was enough to notice some performance issues.
To address this, I decided to transition from Azure Static Web Apps to a better setup using Azure Storage Containers and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN).
In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;re diving into the world of hosting websites on Azure with the added benefit of Azure CDN.</description>

      <description>I was reading a blog by Chad Carlson about Measuring Deployment Success with GitHub Actions and I noticed a stylish deployment counter featured at the bottom of their website, highlighting their platform&amp;rsquo;s successful deployments. While a PaaS provider like platform.sh will have many more deployments than my personal website, I felt inspired to create a similar counter and integrate it into my CI/CD pipeline.
For some context, my website is a static website built using hugo and hosted on Azure as a Static Web App.</description>

      <description>I was reading a blog by Chad Carlson about Measuring Deployment Success with GitHub Actions and I noticed a stylish deployment counter featured at the bottom of their website, highlighting their platform&amp;rsquo;s successful deployments. While a PaaS provider like platform.sh will have many more deployments than my personal website, i feelt inspired to create a similar counter and integrate it into my CI/CD pipeline.
For some context, my website is a static website built using hugo and hosted on Azure as a Static Web App.</description>

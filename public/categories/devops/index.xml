      <description>After publishing my article &amp;ldquo;Integrating a deployment counter to your CI/CD pipeline&amp;rdquo;, my static website recibed about 1.3k visits, not alot but it was enough to notice some performance issues.
To address this, I decided to transition from Azure Static Web Apps to a better setup using Azure Storage Containers and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN).
In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;re diving into the world of hosting websites on Azure with the added benefit of Azure CDN.</description>

      <description>I was reading a blog by Chad Carlson about Measuring Deployment Success with GitHub Actions and I noticed a stylish deployment counter featured at the bottom of their website, highlighting their platform&amp;rsquo;s successful deployments. While a PaaS provider like platform.sh will have many more deployments than my personal website, I felt inspired to create a similar counter and integrate it into my CI/CD pipeline.
For some context, my website is a static website built using hugo and hosted on Azure as a Static Web App.</description>

      <title>Installing an encrypted Proxmox instance</title>

      <description>Although Proxmox VE is a Debian-based Linux distribution, its installer doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer us the possibility of setting up an encrypted LVM. To install proxmox over an encrypted drive we need to install Debian 11 first, change the network configuration, and then install the proxmox packages.
Installing Debian 11 (Bullseye) Download Debian from the official website https://www.debian.org/download, along with the SHA512SUMS and the Signature.
Generate a checksum for the ISO file and save it: sha512sum debian-11.</description>
